## Wheeled Carriages

Whilst you *can* use V-slot wheels on T-slot extrusion (the Tevo Tarantula does), it's not great as the contact surface is very tiny. You also chop up the wheels if you over-tighten them. Just buy V-slot.

## Cutting Aluminium Extrusions

Cut aluminium extrusions with a mitre saw and aluminium blade. Hire a saw if you don't have one.

Saws often come with a horizontal clamp, but it's a good idea to clamp vertically as well.

Put a block of wood on the front and top of multiple extrusions, cut multiple bars at once to ensure the cut is the same on all bars that need to be the same length.

Don't pull the blade back up thru the material, stop it after you've cut down, this leaves a cleaner edge on the ends.

Some places say lubricate the blade with beeswax, kerosene/paraffin, or soap. Some places say do not lubricate the blade.

Keep blade speed slow, a few hundred RPM, using a 7" blade on 10" saw makes the teeth move about the right speed.

## Tapping

Depending on the extrusion, you can tap M5 or M6 into the end of 2020.

Outlaw tapping with Tom: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR85I2ILeGw but that's 2edgy4me, use a hand tap and WD40, Inox, kerosene/paraffin, dishwashing liquid.
