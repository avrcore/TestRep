## Faster Than Light

* Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS
* [Homepage](http://www.ftlgame.com/), [Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/app/212680/), [GOG.com](https://www.gog.com/game/faster_than_light), [FTL Wiki](http://ftlwiki.com/), [FTL Wikia](http://ftl.wikia.com/)

The original. Pilot a single space ship through a series of random galaxies, training your crew and upgrading your ship, in preparation for the final boss battle. Finishing boss battles unlocks further ships.

## Games which I've Played

### Convoy

* Windows, Mac, Linux
* [Homepage](http://convoy-games.com/), [Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/app/318230/), [GOG.com](https://www.gog.com/game/convoy), [Wikia](http://convoy-game.wikia.com/)

"Max Max meets FTL". This game places you in vehicles on a planet where you can free-roam, with 4 main objectives to achieve plus a final boss fight to win the game. Rich world with character, distinct factions, lots of side quests, mini-bosses, and various other achievements. If this isn't as good as FTL, it's damn close!

### Star Jumper

* Android
* [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dmdsoftware.starjumper)

A little mobile FTL clone, distilled down to work better on touchscreen. Has 5 ships to unlock. Ends up pretty easy most of the time. Good game and worth a try.

### PSI: Submarine Combat

* Android
* [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.exanosoftware.psi)

A "love letter to FTL", this game places you underwater in mechanics which strive to be like FTP but just miss the mark for me. Not really worth it, but if you do try it, you probably want a 7" screen or larger.

### Out There: Omega Edition

* Windows, Mac, Linux, Android
* [Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/app/334420/), [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.miclos.google.games.outthere)

Touted as a "lonely, amospheric, single-player FTL" I was disappointed by this. You travel between stars in the hope you can find enough fuel to get to the next star. There's a crafting aspect which is ruined by the fact you don't get enough fuel so you can never carry enough materials, plus the tech tree is completely random so you can miss vital things for most of a playthrough, if you ever get that far. RNGesus is not kind. Thumbs down from me.

## People say these, but are they tho?

### Star Command

* Android, iOS
* [Homepage](http://www.starcommandgame.com/), [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.starcommand.scgame&hl=en)

This is alright, but it doesn't remind me of FTL.

### ASCII Sector

* Windows, Mac, Linux
* [Homepage](http://www.asciisector.net/), [Roguebasin](http://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=Ascii_Sector)

AIUI this is intended to be more like *Wing Commander: Privateer*: The Roguelike. Would probably fit better in a list of Elite-likes.
