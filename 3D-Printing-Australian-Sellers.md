My experiences with 3D printing stores in Australia, in alphabetical order.

## Good Guys

#### Kingdom3D

eSun filament.

#### LearCNC

- http://stores.ebay.com.au/learcnc

All sorts of parts, good quality.

Ben also has lots more in stock which isn't on the eBay store, if you're hunting for something specific, it's worth giving him a yell.

#### MakerMates

- http://stores.ebay.com.au/makermates/

V-slot extrusions including custom lengths at a reasonable price. Other good quality random parts.

These guys have been around for years, great support and help.

## Mixed

#### 3D Printer Superstore

- https://3dprintersuperstore.com.au/

The official E3D reseller. Response to messages is not fantastic, but the product is legit and orders get fulfilled. Better customer service would push them into Good seller bracket.

#### Aurarum

- <http://stores.ebay.com.au/Aurarum>
- <http://aurarum.com.au/>

Some people say their filament is good, some people say it has quality problems like varying size or wildly varying performance from roll to roll.

Several have said their extrusion cuts are quite rough and not accurate or square.

Wombot printer owners are not happy people. That was a reasonable design back in 2012, but it should not be for sale anymore. Even just supplying blatant Prusa clones would be better than Wombots.

Some of their other stuff has been fine.

## Bad

* Sintron

Just reselling cheap Chinese crap for 5x the price. Provided me completely useless parts which didn't work, then argued the toss about providing a refund, then hassled me more about leaving them negative feedback. I wouldn't give them my money if they were the last parts seller on the planet. Avoid.
