## Joystick Wiring

The Mad Catz joystick uses the same wiring as Sanwa joysticks, which you can easily find online.

You don't need to clip wires to create a Sanwa-to-Mad-Catz cable. Buy a Sanwa wiring harness, take the wires out of the Mad Catz connector with a needle, and put them into the Sanwa connector. Change them over one at a time so you don't get the wiring mixed up.

Looking at the stick from the top (not from the underside):
