## About

This is a wiki of useful advice I commonly give or have seen on places like StackExchange and Reddit. Sometimes I will link directly to useful posts, sometimes I will make a page on here and curate content.

## License

Unless otherwise noted per-page, all information here is provided under [Creative Commons - Attribution - Share Alike](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/). Anyone is more than welcome to steal this stuff, but you must give credit and you must provide others the same rights.

## Money

If you wish to give a financial thanks for any advice, please don't buy me Reddit Gold or Thingiverse Tips, instead make a donation to [Abandoned Pet Project](http://abandonedpetproject.org/donate) or an animal rescue charity in your area.
