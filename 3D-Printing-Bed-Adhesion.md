Here's my experience with different bed adhesion methods.

### Legend

* ![][y] Yes! Perfect adhesion for tricky prints (may have to use brim or adhesion pads)
* ![][s] Sorta. Alright for smaller parts, anything tricky warps.
* ![][n] No. Poor adhesion, absolute failure.
* ![][t] To Do. Haven't tried yet.
