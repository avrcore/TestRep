AM1800 is Taulman n-vent
PETT is Taulman t-glase

### Dummies Guide

I am by no means a mechanical engineer and have only an armchair understanding of these properties.

#### Temperature

* Glass Transition: starts to deform
* Melt Temperature: becomes liquid
* PC best, ABS good, PETG not too bad, PLA and Nylon bad

#### Stretch

* Elastic Modulus (Young's Modulus or Tensile Modulus): higher = less stretchy
* Tensile Strength: higher = resists stretch more
* Nylon best, PC second best, PETG good and will deform at limit, PLA close and will crack quickly at limit

#### Bending

* Flexural Modulus: higher = less bendy
* Flexural Strength: higher = resists bending more
* Nylon best, ABS and PC good and will deform at limit, PLA alright and will crack quickly at limit, PETG a tad weaker and will deform at limit

#### Squish

* Compressive Strength: resists compression more
* PC, Nylon, PETG best, PLA and ABS not so good

#### Breaking

* Elongation: how much a stress curve rises, less means crack, more means deform out of shape

## Coefficient of Friction

I don't really understand this well, and there are a lot of different results from different source, but anyway, I hope this is a good table of Dynamic Coefficient of Friction vs steel:

| Material        | Value |
|-----------------|-------|
| PTFE (Teflon)   | 0.04 to 0.05 |
| Sintered Bronze | 0.12 |
| Bronze          | 0.16
| Brass           | 0.19 |
| POM             | 0.2 |
| PET-P           | 0.2 |
| PET-G           | 0.22 |
| PET             | 0.25 |
| Nylon 6,6       | 0.26 |
| ABS             | 0.35 |
| PLA             | 0.38 to 0.45 |
| PC              | 0.38 to 0.5  |
