## Brief Thoughts

* TODO: Dimensions of LMxUU and LMxLUU bearings
* PLA is good, lubricate with dry PTFE oil or silicone spray
    * Russ from RWG found silicone was better than other lubricants
* ABS is not good
* PETG is said to be good, but haven't found anyone who's actually done it
* Nylon is supposed to be good and self-lubricating, but Jean-Daniel from the HyperCube Facebook group tried Nylon and called it a fail
* People say plastic bearings suffer "stick" when moving from idle
* Igus *Drylin* polymer bearings are an option
    * Watch the OD, only RJUM-02 Compact carrier has OD the same as LMxUU
    * You are supposed to press-fit the un-enclosed bearings?
    * Other models come in an aluminium carrier which actually takes *iglide J* bushings
    * You could also print bushing holders for *iglide J* polymer bushings
    * Igus also have a *Tribofilament* for printing bearings which is really expensive (US$100/kg available in 750g rolls), the marketing material says it's way better than ABS and very close to PETG
* Oil-impregnated bronze-coated steel with graphite pads are another option
    * Apparently a 5B or softer (8B, 12B, etc) pencil should have sufficient graphite and little enough clay binder
    * Todo: That printer grade-to-graphite content list which is floating around
